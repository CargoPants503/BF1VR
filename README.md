### This is a full VR mod for Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)
#### Note this is a work-in-progress
_This is the beta version. The alpha version is archived at [IfanSnek/BF2VR-Alpha](https://github.com/IfanSnek/BF2VR-Alpha/)_

## Installation
Download the ZIP file from the releases page **when it's available.**

Extract to a folder, then whitelist that folder in Windows Defender/Antivirus.

*That's all :)*

## Usage
1) Launch Battlefront II and wait for at least the menu to load. See mandatory settings below.

2) Enter an **Arcade** match. No starfighters (yet).

3) Open your OpenXR runtime (Oculus grid area, SteamVR mountains, Virtual Desktop just neads to have VDXR enabled)

4) Double click `Loader.exe`. The VR will show the game now, see the controls section.

5) (Optional) Use the delete key to eject. This will crash the game sometimes but it's worth it if you would need to close the game for some reason anyway.

### Mandatory settings:
* DirectX 12 - Off
* TAA - High (it's disabled anyway but it must be on high)
* Window mode - borderless

### Controls
*Assumes the equivalent for an Oculus Touch controller.*

**Left thumb:** Walk

**A:** Jump

**B:** Dodge

**X:** Reload

**Y:** They call it "basic weapon"

*A/B/X/Y buttons are the same as the normal Xbox controls.*

**Left trigger:** Sprint

**Right trigger:** Fire

**Left Grip:** Left ability

**Right Grip:** Right ability

**Left and right grip:** Middle ability

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not play online. You will likely be banned. And unlike Palpatine, you're not allowed back. You can use [Kyber](https://github.com/ArmchairDevelopers/Kyber) servers though.
